        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>At Thrift.Floor, we believe in more than just selling clothes—we're building a community of people who care about fashion, sustainability, and great deals. Founded by a small team of passionate individuals, our shop is run by 4-5 dedicated people who are constantly working to offer the best thrifted clothing options available. Every item we sell is carefully selected to ensure it meets our high standards of quality and style, all while being affordably priced.

            Our mission is to provide our customers with unique, high-quality fashion pieces at unbeatable prices. We believe in the power of secondhand fashion to help reduce waste and promote sustainability, which is why we make sure every item we sell is in excellent condition, ready to be worn and loved by its new owner.
            
            Currently, we are accepting orders exclusively on our Instagram account, where we showcase our latest collection and interact with our growing community. Follow us on Instagram to keep up with our newest arrivals, special promotions, and behind-the-scenes glimpses into our process.
            
            What's Next? We’re excited to announce that in the coming months, we’ll be expanding our services and accepting orders directly through our website! This means you'll be able to browse our full collection, place orders, and enjoy a seamless shopping experience, all in one place. Stay tuned for updates as we work to make our online store even better, and be the first to know when we launch!
